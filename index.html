  <h1>Welcome to Lukes Shed</h1>
  <br>
  <h3>What is Luke shed?</h3>
  <br>
  <p>Luke Shed is a coding project by a middle schooler, Luke Ripple. Due to problems with my school's administration this website may be down in the future. I made this website back in 2021 in 7th grade. For anyone that will tell me to put it back up, the code is open source. That doesn't mean it is legal to take my code without my licensed permission.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Who helped make Luke Shed?</h3>
  <br>
  <p>Nobody helped me make Luke Shed, but a lot of people gave me ideas like, Zaman, Jake, Luke Bronder(og) and Andy D. Though if the admins are reading this, none of their inspiration led to the site.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Is there a discord?</h3>
  <br>
  <p>I know nobody is asking that but I made one anyway. So here's the link: <a href="https://discord.gg/23TrDk6qDs">https://discord.gg/23TrDk6qDs</a>. If you're on a school computer then too bad, if Discord is blocked. Also I had another Discord with members but it's v40 so yeah.</p>
